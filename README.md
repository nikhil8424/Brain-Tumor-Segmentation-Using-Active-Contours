# Brain Tumor Segmentation using Active Contour Models

This repository provides an implementation of an Active Contour (Snake) algorithm for the segmentation of brain tumors in medical images. The project leverages Python's OpenCV and NumPy libraries to process images and detect tumor boundaries with precision.



## Introduction

Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical image analysis. The goal of this project is to implement a contour-based segmentation technique, known as Active Contours or Snakes, to accurately outline brain tumors in grayscale medical images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. The required Python libraries can be installed via `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
